    // 
    //     
    // HOW TO GET A BEST MOVE:  
    // IN GENERAL start with a list of movesToConsider. in a given position make a list of winning moves and losing moves. 
    //            if there are any winning moves return that list, if not remove all losing moves from the list of movesToConsider.
    //            if there are no movesToConsider left return a random move
    //            if there are movesToConsider make a list of hypotheticalPositions by adding each moveToConsider to the originalMoveList...
    //            at this point we are guaranteed that none of the hypotheticalPositions contain an immediate win so we only need to list moves that are notImmediatelyLosing
    //              For Each notImmediatelyLosingMove in each hypotheticalPosition create a new  hypotheticalPosition that concats the notImmediatelyLosingMove onto the hypotheticalPosition where it is the opponents move. 
    // 
    //              as we cycle thru the hypotheticalPositions we chech each to see if in it is whoseTurn or opponentsTurn by comparing it length % 2 with originalMoveList.length % 2 
    //              if we are currently considering a position where it is the opponentsTurn we are guaranteed they can't win so we list moves they can make that are notImmediatelyLosing
    //              For Each notImmediatelyLosingMove in each hypotheticalPosition create a new  hypotheticalPosition that concats the notImmediatelyLosingMove onto the hypotheticalPosition currently being considered. 
    //              if we are currently considering a position where it is whoseTurn we make a list of winning moves and losing moves. 

    // There will be a methd for getting immediate wins and one for filtering the unclaimed squares and removing immediatelyLosing movesToConsider
    // movesToConsider need not be state, it can 
    //              
    //  
    // 1) Start with the current position and look for winning moves. if there are none...
    //    This list is the intersection of unclaimedNumbers and winningNumbers. 
    // 2) 
    // 3) For Each unclaimedNumber, test if adding it to myMoves creates a Set where there are   Make a list of all unclaimedNumbers that are also winningNumbers.
    // A "best move" is any move that does not grant the opponent a forced win. Start with a list of legal moves. if any win return only those. if any lose return all but those.
    // WHEREAS Tic-Tac-Toe has a "complete" solution, this Bot only does the best it can and will attempt an urgentDefensiveMove even if there are too many to block them all. 
    
    // For this function to opperate recursively there must be two parameters, the position in which to look for winning moves, and the losing moves that have already been ruled out on previous calls. 
    
    // When it becomes the bot's turn it will first look for winning moves by making recursive calls : 
    //   Both parameters are integer arrays. on the first recursive call losingMoves[] and winningMoves[] are empty.
    // if creates a Queue as in breadth first graph search. 
    
    // 
    // A move is winning IFF it leaves your opponent with no sound replies. 
    //    because after they make a reply i WILL make a winning move.  Winning in the most
    //    expedient way is the only "sound" practice.  Making this model less thorough than what I implemented for tic-tac-toe
    // A move is sound if no matter how your opponent replies you will have a sound reply.
    

    // From a moveList it determines the posible moves then removes those that lead to a lose or grant a forcing move that ... leads to a loss.
    // Starting from an empty board... what are the sound moves?
